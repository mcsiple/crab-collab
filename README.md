# Project description
This project is an attempt to characterize the Samoan crab (<i>Scylla serrata</i>) fishery in Kaneohe Bay, and examine the impacts of different harvest rules on the sustainability of the stock. This is a chpater of Kaleolani Hurley's dissertation on native harvest of introduced species.

The two project questions are:
1) Will the current management regime (size and sex limits) be sustainable for managing Samoan crab in the fishpond in the long-term?
2) Are there alternative control rules that might increase yield in the fishery?

The code produces survival rates and a growth probability matrix from mark-recapture data, then simulates abundance and harvest based on future scenarios.

# Author contributions 
This simulation study uses mark-recapture data from Kaleo Hurley's field study and a Leslie matrix population model from Maia Kapur. Megsie Siple wrote the code to produce the growth-transition matrix and adult natural mortality estimates.
